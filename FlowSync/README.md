# OpenAI Task Management System

> Generated by [Gryffin](https://github.com/gryffin) - AI-powered development tool

## Overview

A web application that utilizes OpenAI's API to manage tasks and streamline communication using natural language processing for noise filtering, task drafting, and response drafting.

## What This App IS

- **Backend**: Component functionality
- **Database**: Component functionality
- **Frontend**: Component functionality

## What This App IS NOT

- Not designed for: Users are familiar with basic task management systems
- Not designed for: OpenAI API can effectively filter noise and draft tasks reliably
- Not designed for: The application will handle expected user load effectively without major performance issues

## System Configuration

- **Operating System**: Darwin 25.2.0
- **Python Version**: 3.9.6
- **Django**: 4.2.27

## Tech Stack


## Data Flow

User submits a task via the frontend. The request is sent to the Flask backend, which interacts with the OpenAI API to filter noise, draft tasks and generate responses. Processed data is stored in MongoDB and sent back to the frontend for user interaction.

## Known Risks & Limitations

- ⚠️  Dependency on OpenAI's API availability and performance
- ⚠️  Data privacy and security issues related to user data
- ⚠️  Potential for high API usage costs

## Assumptions

- Users are familiar with basic task management systems
- OpenAI API can effectively filter noise and draft tasks reliably
- The application will handle expected user load effectively without major performance issues

## Development

This project was generated and is being developed using Gryffin, an AI-powered development tool that:
