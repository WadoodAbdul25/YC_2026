# Feedback Integration System

> Generated by [Gryffin](https://github.com/gryffin) - AI-powered development tool

## Overview

A React.js frontend is being developed to connect with an existing Django backend. This project aims to create an interactive UI for user feedback, employing Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a modern and responsive design.

## What This App IS

- **Backend**: Component functionality
- **Frontend**: Component functionality

## What This App IS NOT

- Not designed for: The Django backend is fully functional and can handle incoming API requests.
- Not designed for: Team is familiar with React.js and Tailwind CSS for frontend development.
- Not designed for: Development environments for both frontend and backend are properly set up.

## System Configuration

- **Operating System**: Darwin 24.5.0
- **Python Version**: 3.13.2
- **Node.js**: v23.7.0
- **Django**: 6.0.1

## Tech Stack


## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the React frontend.
2. Frontend sends requests to the Django backend via RESTful APIs.
3. Django processes requests and interacts with the database as needed.
4. Django responds with the relevant data to the frontend.
5. Frontend updates the UI based on the data received from the backend.

## Known Risks & Limitations

- ⚠️  Potential issues with CORS if not properly configured on the backend.
- ⚠️  Version compatibility between React and Django libraries.
- ⚠️  Styling inconsistencies could arise due to Tailwind CSS integration.

## Assumptions

- The Django backend is fully functional and can handle incoming API requests.
- Team is familiar with React.js and Tailwind CSS for frontend development.
- Development environments for both frontend and backend are properly set up.
