[2026-01-25T18:59:03Z] n email parser called flowsync, which takes emails in json format, and filters out all the attention needed tasks, and drafts human like responses to the ones that needs a response and then draft tasks so the person can add it to their calendar. make sure you account for latency, it needs to be fast, and it needs to be accurate when filtering out and identifying which need attendtion, hence which need response vs which need task vs both.
